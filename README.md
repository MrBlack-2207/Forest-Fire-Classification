# Forest Fire Classification using MODIS Active Fire Data â€“ India (2021)

This project focuses on predicting the **type of forest fire** detected by NASAâ€™s MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite data using **machine learning classification algorithms**. MODIS operates aboard the **Terra** and **Aqua** satellites, capturing vital environmental data for monitoring wildfires globally.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset used is **MODIS Active Fire Data (India, 2021)**, which contains ~12,000 records with the following features:

- **latitude, longitude** â€“ Geographical coordinates of detected fire pixels.  
- **brightness, bright_t31** â€“ Brightness temperature (in Kelvin).  
- **scan, track** â€“ MODIS pixel dimensions on the Earthâ€™s surface.  
- **acq_time** â€“ Time of fire detection.  
- **satellite** â€“ Source satellite (Terra / Aqua).  
- **instrument** â€“ MODIS sensor.  
- **confidence** â€“ Detection confidence score (0â€“100).  
- **frp** â€“ Fire radiative power (MW).  
- **daynight** â€“ Time of detection (Day/Night).  
- **type** â€“ Target variable:  
  - `0` â€“ Presumed vegetation fire  
  - `1` â€“ Active volcano  
  - `2` â€“ Other static land source  
  - `3` â€“ Offshore

## ðŸ¤– Models Implemented

### 1. Logistic Regression  
- Solver: `liblinear` with L2 regularization.  
- **Accuracy:** 93%  
- **Strength:** Perfect recall for type `0`.  
- **Weakness:** Underfitting due to high bias.  

### 2. K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)  
- Optimal `K = 2` (determined via accuracy plot).  
- **Accuracy:** 95%  
- **Weakness:** More misclassifications for type `0` than Logistic Regression.  

### 3. XGBoost (Best Performing Model)  
- Chosen to reduce bias and improve performance.  
- Optimal hyperparameters found using `GridSearchCV`:  
  - `n_estimators = 200`  
  - `max_features = 4`  
- **Accuracy:** 98%  
- Less than 2% misclassifications.

## ðŸ“Š Results & Conclusion
- **XGBoost** outperforms Logistic Regression and KNN, providing the highest accuracy and balanced precision-recall.  
- Logistic Regression and KNN showed signs of underfitting, while XGBoost effectively handled bias and variance.  
- **Final Recommendation:** Use XGBoost for forest fire type prediction on MODIS data.
